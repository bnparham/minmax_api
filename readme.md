# Building Efficient APIs for AI Algorithms in Django: A Step-by-Step Guide with the Min-Max Algorithm

The Min-Max algorithm is a decision-making tool used in game theory, primarily for zero-sum games where one player's gain is another's loss. It evaluates the game tree by assuming that the opponent is playing optimally and aims to either maximize or minimize the outcome, depending on the role.
